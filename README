install node, then

node install

npm rebuild

then

node app.js



! a note on the includes: at runtime everything is fine but during the loading sequence of course race conditions/circular dependencies can happen, so I've put the require statement next to their use cases in the base modules and not at the top when possible.


When deploying to a new environment, you might want to change
bin/
src/client/init_environment.js
src/environment.ts


<!-- THIS FILE DEPENDS ON THE ENVIRONMENT.
<!-- YOU PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE IT IGNOREDBY GIT: -->
<!-- git update-index --assume-unchanged client.html -->

<!-- IF YOU CHANGE IT, MAKE SURE TO UPDATE THE IP OF THE SOCKET AND TO MAKE IT KNOWN TO GIT. -->
<!-- git update-index --no-assume-unchanged client.html -->








This mostly revolves around loading "games" which are in maxigames, minigames or othergames.
Each folder can have the following optional files :
- client.js will be executed by clients
- server.ts will be executed by the server
- client.html will be rendered in html body of clients
- setup.html will be rendered in html body of clients while there is a readycheck going on.

theyre executed once, but GameEngine.memory can hold info for you through the game

module vs class
